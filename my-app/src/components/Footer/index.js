            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the footer must be fixed as the header, there is a way of doing it?
                </li>
                <li>
                    that move is part of HOC or high order components, in resume is the way of you re use pure components.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    )

export default Footer;
